# aws_vpc_endpoint_service

Provides a VPC Endpoint Service resource. Service consumers can create an Interface VPC Endpoint to connect to the service.

NOTE on VPC Endpoint Services and VPC Endpoint Service Allowed Principals: Terraform provides both a standalone VPC Endpoint Service Allowed Principal resource and a VPC Endpoint Service resource with an allowed_principals attribute. Do not use the same principal ARN in both a VPC Endpoint Service resource and a VPC Endpoint Service Allowed Principal resource. Doing so will cause a conflict and will overwrite the association.
