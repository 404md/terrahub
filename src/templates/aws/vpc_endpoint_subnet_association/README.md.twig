# aws_vpc_endpoint_subnet_association

Provides a resource to create an association between a VPC endpoint and a subnet.

NOTE on VPC Endpoints and VPC Endpoint Subnet Associations: Terraform provides both a standalone VPC Endpoint Subnet Association (an association between a VPC endpoint and a single subnet_id) and a VPC Endpoint resource with a subnet_ids attribute. Do not use the same subnet ID in both a VPC Endpoint resource and a VPC Endpoint Subnet Association resource. Doing so will cause a conflict of associations and will overwrite the association.
