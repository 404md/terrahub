# aws_rds_cluster

Provides an RDS Cluster Resource. A Cluster Resource defines attributes that are applied to the entire cluster of RDS Cluster Instances. Use the RDS Cluster resource and RDS Cluster Instances to create and use Amazon Aurora, a MySQL-compatible database engine.

For more information on Amazon Aurora, see Aurora on Amazon RDS in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

For information on the difference between the available Aurora MySQL engines see Comparison between Aurora MySQL 1 and Aurora MySQL 2 in the Amazon RDS User Guide.

Changes to a RDS Cluster can occur when you manually change a parameter, such as port, and are reflected in the next maintenance window. Because of this, Terraform may report a difference in its planning phase because a modification has not yet taken place. You can use the apply_immediately flag to instruct the service to apply the change immediately (see documentation below).

Note: using apply_immediately can result in a brief downtime as the server reboots. See the AWS Docs on RDS Maintenance for more information.

Note: All arguments including the username and password will be stored in the raw state as plain-text. Read more about sensitive data in state.
