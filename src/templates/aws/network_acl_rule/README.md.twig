# aws_network_acl_rule

Creates an entry (a rule) in a network ACL with the specified rule number.

NOTE on Network ACLs and Network ACL Rules: Terraform currently provides both a standalone Network ACL Rule resource and a Network ACL resource with rules defined in-line. At this time you cannot use a Network ACL with in-line rules in conjunction with any Network ACL Rule resources. Doing so will cause a conflict of rule settings and will overwrite rules.
